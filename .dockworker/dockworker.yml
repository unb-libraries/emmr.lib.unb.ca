      Early Modern Maritime Recipes examines recipes circulating before 1800 in 
      print and manuscript in the area now defined as Canada's Maritime provinces. 
      Early modern recipe writing focused on food and medicine, but recorded a 
      range of other practices associated with alchemy, cosmetics, veterinary, 
      medicine, and laundry, amongst other things. These recipes are texts about 
      knowledge exchange and social networks. They reflect the commercial, social, 
      and familial relationships involved in the acquisition of knowledge, record 
      the use of goods in making products, and connect domestic practices and 
      institutionalized learning. Early Modern Maritime Recipes compiles a record 
      of extant recipes by digitizing and transcribing recipes from archival 
      collections throughout the Maritime provinces.
